# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote respoistory is a way to keep an offsite backup. It is also an easy way
to collaborate with other people on a project. 


# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because other users may be pushing to the GitHub site I may not have branched
the changes that I was making and do not want them to be merged and kept up to 
date all of the time.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - a clone between two repositories on GitHub
Clone - a copy of an existing repository
branches - a tree like structure of commits seperated down the trunk


# What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This allows you to continue to code and merge offline with the latest known
version of the master at the time. It also means that there will be less conflicts
when connecting back to the remote.
