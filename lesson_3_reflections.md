# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote respoistory is a way to keep an offsite backup. It is also an easy way
to collaborate with other people on a project. 


# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because other users may be pushing to the GitHub site I may not have branched
the changes that I was making and do not want them to be merged and kept up to 
date all of the time.
